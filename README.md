# Python_WebScrapper
This script uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape a website for information. It first defines the URL of the website you want to scrape, then uses requests to get the contents of the website. It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the page and extract the information you want, in this case the elements on the page with the class "article-title". Finally, it loops through the elements and prints the text of each one.

Keep in mind that website owners may not appreciate having their content scraped without their permission, so it's always a good idea to check the website's terms of service before scraping it for information.
